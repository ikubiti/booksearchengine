## Description

This project converts a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API to one using GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The application allow users to save their favorite book and follow-up to the books link at Google Books to purchase it or get more information.
